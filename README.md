## Overview
Here we are going to do five tasks from our Cloud computing course
- An application development using Node.js
- Cloud access and Application development using Docker
- Building Microservices application
- Application deployment using Kubernetes
- Exercise on FaaS


### Application development using Node.js
- Created an application using **Node.js** for book management system i.e. we can store books with the necessary information and perform some operations on that like updating, deletion, etc.
- We use **MongoDB** as a database for that and **REST** based APIs.
- After that we have hosted this application on **GCP**(Google cloud platform)
- Also applied **reverse proxy** just for getting the flavour of it :)
