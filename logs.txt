Here you will find out the different procedures I used in this course also the problems I faced:
- Installed all the required stuff like npm, node and mongoDB
- We have to run an application in the VM.
- Used GCP and hosted the application there
- I tried to change the port from 80 to 8080 
- also made reverse proxy just for fun and match port:8080 to 80

Exercise 2.
-Problems with the deployment method with the 1st exercise
a) OS Dependent: Different deployment procedure and requirements for different OS.
b) Not-Scalable: Run on ore Laptops or VMs
c) Not-Portable: Running the same procedure from starting again on the new machine. Time consuming

Containerization(container based virtualization)

It is an OS-level virtualization method for deploying and running distributed applications without launching an entire VM for each application.
It share the same OS kernel as host.
