Here you will find out the different procedures I used in this course also the problems I faced:
- Installed all the required stuff like npm, node and mongoDB
- We have to run an application in the VM.
- Used GCP and hosted the application there
- I tried to change the port from 80 to 8080 
- also made reverse proxy just for fun and match port:8080 to 80

Exercise 2.
-Problems with the deployment method with the 1st exercise
a) OS Dependent: Different deployment procedure and requirements for different OS.
b) Not-Scalable: Run on ore Laptops or VMs
c) Not-Portable: Running the same procedure from starting again on the new machine. Time consuming

Containerization(container based virtualization)

It is an OS-level virtualization method for deploying and running distributed applications without launching an entire VM for each application.
It share the same OS kernel as host.

Exercise 3
Building the microservices

Here we are deploying the 3 microservices:
- product-price
- product-description
- book-name

Instead of a database we just created a MockData.json file which contains all the records, and we have to find the details of those records.

The idea is if a user will give a product id then we have to return the product name, price and url.

Steps for deploying the application in GCP.
METHOD 1:
If you have arm64 based machine like linux distribution.
- run the application in the local.
- push the images to the docker hub using the command docker push name_of_image
- just copy the docker-compose.yml file to the VM on GCP
- and now run the 'docker-compose up', what it will do is it will pull the images form the docker hub and then run the application
* if you changed the code then do 'docker-compose up --build'
 
METHOD 2:
If you have amd64 based machine like mac m1
- now for this ther are again 2 option
1st option: 
do as you did above but while building the images use buildx command so that it will build the images for amd64

2nd option :
push the entire application code to the VM on GCP and then run the docker-compose up command it will build it, here in this it will not pull the images from the docker hub because we are building the images here itself.

You can follow this option in linux also if you want to avoid the docker hub thing
